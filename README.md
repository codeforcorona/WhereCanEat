##About us:
We are a team of 3 NUS students who worked together to develop this application.


##Tech stack:
Front-end: Nuxt.js, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS
Back-end: Node.js

##Mission:
We are dedicated to helping you find the best and most value-for-money food merchants around. We want to show all the food delivery options in one place: a simpler alternative to the various food delivery options that make ordering food much more complicated that it should be.
